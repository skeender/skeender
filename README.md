Hey there, I'm Skanda Acharya, an 11-year-old. While other kids were into cartoons, I was hooked on coding – Python, to be exact. Coding's like solving puzzles for me, but I'm not just a one-trick pony. When the sun sets, I transform into a gaming maestro, conquering virtual worlds and leaving my friends in awe. Oh, and speaking of conquests, my biggest love after coding and gaming? Dumplings! These delightful treats power my coding marathons, and rumor has it I once out-ate my computer in a dumpling duel. So, that's me – Skanda Acharya – where coding meets gaming, and dumplings fuel the fun!
